Summary: The Rich Text Format (RTF) Specification provides a format for text
and graphics interchange that can be used with different output devices,
operating environments, and operating systems. RTF uses the American National
Standards Institute (ANSI), PC-8, Macintosh, or IBM PC character set to
control the representation and formatting of a document, both on the screen
and in print. With the RTF Specification, documents created under different
operating systems and with different software applications can be transferred
between those operating systems and applications. (248 printed pages)

Introduction				*rtf-introduction*

The Rich Text Format (RTF) Specification is a method of encoding formatted
text and graphics for easy transfer between applications. Currently, users
depend on special translation software to move word-processing documents
between different MS-DOS(tm), Microsoft(tm) Windows(tm), OS/2, Macintosh(tm),
and Power Macintosh(tm) applications.

The RTF Specification provides a format for text and graphics interchange that
can be used with different output devices, operating environments, and
operating systems. RTF uses the American National Standards Institute (ANSI),
PC-8, Macintosh, or IBM PC character set to control the representation and
formatting of a document, both on the screen and in print. With the RTF
Specification, documents created under different operating systems and with
different software applications can be transferred between those operating
systems and applications. RTF files created in Word 6.0 (and later) for the
Macintosh and Power Macintosh have a file type of "RTF."

Software that takes a formatted file and turns it into an RTF file is called
a writer. An RTF writer separates the application's control information from
the actual text and writes a new file containing the text and the RTF groups
associated with that text. Software that translates an RTF file into
a formatted file is called a reader.

A sample RTF reader application is available (see the Appendix A: Sample RTF
Reader Application section of this document). It is designed for use with the
specification to assist those interested in developing their own RTF readers.
This application and its use are described in Appendix A. The sample RTF
reader is not a for-sale product, and Microsoft does not provide technical or
any other type of support for the sample RTF reader code or the RTF
specification. For more information on how to download the sample RTF reader
from the Microsoft Download Center, please visit the following Web address:
www.microsoft.com/downloads/search.asp and then search on "RTF Reader."

RTF Version 1.6 includes all new control words introduced by Microsoft Word
for Windows 95 version 7.0, Word 97 for Windows, Word 98 for the Macintosh,
and Word 2000 for Windows, as well as other Microsoft products.

==============================================================================
RTF Syntax				*rtf-syntax*

An RTF file consists of unformatted text, control words, control
symbols, and groups. For ease of transport, a standard RTF file can
consist of only 7-bit ASCII characters. (Converters that communicate
with Microsoft Word for Windows or Microsoft Word for the Macintosh
should expect 8-bit characters.) There is no set maximum line length for
an RTF file.

A control word is a specially formatted command that RTF uses to mark
printer control codes and information that applications use to manage
documents. A control word cannot be longer than 32 characters. A control
word takes the following form:

       \LetterSequence<Delimiter>
Note   A backslash begins each control word.

The LetterSequence is made up of lowercase alphabetic characters (a-z).
RTF is case sensitive.

The following Word 97-2000 keywords do not currently follow the
requirement that keywords may not contain any uppercase alphabetic
characters. All writers should still follow this rule, and Word will
also emit completely lowercase versions of all these keywords in the
next version. In the meantime, those implementing readers are advised to
treat them as exceptions:

	    \clFitText
	    \clftsWidthN
	    \clNoWrap
	    \clwWidthN
	    \tdfrmtxtBottomN
	    \tdfrmtxtLeftN
	    \tdfrmtxtRightN
	    \tdfrmtxtTopN
	    \trftsWidthAN
	    \trftsWidthBN
	    \trftsWidthN
	    \trwWidthAN
	    \trwWidthBN
	    \trwWidthN
	    \sectspecifygenN

The delimiter marks the end of an RTF control word, and can be one of
the following:

  - A space. In this case, the space is part of the control word.
  - A digit or a hyphen (-), which indicates that a numeric parameter
    follows. The subsequent digital sequence is then delimited by a space or
    any character other than a letter or a digit. The parameter can be
    a positive or a negative number. The range of the values for the number
    is generally -32767 through 32767. However, Word tends to restrict the
    range to -31680 through 31680. Word allows values in the range
    -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,648 for a small number of keywords
    (specifically |\bin|, |\revdttm|, and some picture properties). An RTF
    parser must handle an arbitrary string of digits as a legal value for
    a keyword. If a numeric parameter immediately follows the control word,
    this parameter becomes part of the control word. The control word is
    then delimited by a space or a nonalphabetic or nonnumeric character in
    the same manner as any other control word.
  - Any character other than a letter or a digit. In this case, the
    delimiting character terminates the control word but is not actually
    part of the control word.

If a space delimits the control word, the space does not appear in the
document. Any characters following the delimiter, including spaces, will
appear in the document. For this reason, you should use spaces only
where necessary; do not use spaces merely to break up RTF code.

A control symbol consists of a backslash followed by a single,
nonalphabetic character. For example, |\~| represents a nonbreaking
space.  Control symbols take no delimiters.

A group consists of text and control words or control symbols enclosed
in braces ({ }). The opening brace ({ ) indicates the start of the group
and the closing brace ( }) indicates the end of the group. Each group
specifies the text affected by the group and the different attributes of
that text. The RTF file can also include groups for fonts, styles,
screen color, pictures, footnotes, comments (annotations), headers and
footers, summary information, fields, and bookmarks, as well as
document-, section-, paragraph-, and character-formatting properties. If
the font, file, style, screen-color, revision mark, and
summary-information groups and document-formatting properties are
included, they must precede the first plain-text character in the
document. These groups form the RTF file header. If the group for fonts
is included, it should precede the group for styles. If any group is not
used, it can be omitted. The groups are discussed in the following
sections.

The control properties of certain control words (such as bold, italic,
keep together, and so on) have only two states. When such a control word
has no parameter or has a nonzero parameter, it is assumed that the
control word turns on the property. When such a control word has
a parameter of 0 , it is assumed that the control word turns off the
property. For example, \b turns on bold, whereas \b0 turns off bold.

Certain control words, referred to as destinations, mark the beginning
of a collection of related text that could appear at another position,
or destination, within the document. Destinations may also be text that
is used but should not appear within the document. An example of
a destination is the |\footnote| group, where the footnote text follows
the control word. Page breaks cannot occur in destination text.
Destination control words and their following text must be enclosed in
braces. No other control words or text may appear within the destination
group. Destinations added after the RTF Specification published in the
March 1987 Microsoft Systems Journal may be preceded by the control
symbol \* (|\-asterix|). This control symbol identifies destinations
whose related text should be ignored if the RTF reader does not
recognize the destination. (RTF writers should follow the convention of
using this control symbol when adding new destinations or groups.)
Destinations whose related text should be inserted into the document,
even if the RTF reader does not recognize the destination, should not
use \*. All destinations that were not included in the March 1987
revision of the RTF Specification are shown with \* as part of the
control word.

Formatting specified within a group affects only the text within that
group. Generally, text within a group inherits the formatting of the
text in the preceding group. However, Microsoft implementations of RTF
assume that the footnote, annotation, header, and footer groups
(described later in this chapter) do not inherit the formatting of the
preceding text. Therefore, to ensure that these groups are always
formatted correctly, you should set the formatting within these groups
to the default with the |\sectd|, |\pard|, and |\plain| control words, and
then add any desired formatting.

The control words, control symbols, and braces constitute control
information. All other characters in the file are plain text. Here is an
example of plain text that does not exist within a group:
>
    {\rtf\ansi\deff0{\fonttbl{\f0\froman Tms Rmn;}{\f1\fdecor
    Symbol;}{\f2\fswiss Helv;}}{\colortbl;\red0\green0\blue0;
    \red0\green0\blue255;\red0\green255\blue255;\red0\green255\
    blue0;\red255\green0\blue255;\red255\green0\blue0;\red255\
    green255\blue0;\red255\green255\blue255;}{\stylesheet{\fs20
    \snext0Normal;}}{\info{\author John Doe}
    {\creatim\yr1990\mo7\dy30\hr10\min48}{\version1}{\edmins0}
    {\nofpages1}{\nofwords0}{\nofchars0}{\vern8351}}\widoctrl\ftnbj
    \sectd\linex0\endnhere \pard\plain \fs20 This is plain
    text.\par}

The phrase "This is plain text" is not part of a group and is treated as
document text.
				                 *\* *{* *}* *{}*
As previously mentioned, the backslash (\) and braces ({ }) have special
meaning in RTF. To use these characters as text, precede them with
a backslash, as in \\, \{, and \}.

==============================================================================
Conventions of an RTF Reader		*rtf-reader-conventions*

The reader of an RTF stream is concerned with the following:

  - Separating control information from plain text.
  
  - Acting on control information.
  
  - Collecting and properly inserting text into the document, as directed by the
    current group state.

Acting on control information is designed to be a relatively simple process.
Some control information simply contributes special characters to the plain
text stream. Other information serves to change the program state, which
includes properties of the document as a whole, or to change any of a
collection of group states, which apply to parts of the document.


As previously mentioned, a group state can specify the following:

  - The destination, or part of the document that the plain text is constructing.
  
  - Character-formatting properties, such as bold or italic.
  
  - Paragraph-formatting properties, such as justified or centered.
  
  - Section-formatting properties, such as the number of columns.
  
  - Table-formatting properties, which define the number of cells and dimensions
    of a table row.


In practice, an RTF reader will evaluate each character it reads in sequence
as follows:

  - If the character is an opening brace ({), the reader stores its current
    state on the stack. If the character is a closing brace (}), the reader
    retrieves the current state from the stack.
  
  - If the character is a backslash (\), the reader collects the control word
    or control symbol and its parameter, if any, and looks up the control word
    or control symbol in a table that maps control words to actions. It then
    carries out the action prescribed in the table. (The possible actions are
    discussed below.) The read pointer is left before or after a control-word
    delimiter, as appropriate.
  
  - If the character is anything other than an opening brace ({), closing brace
    (}), or backslash (\), the reader assumes that the character is plain text
    and writes the character to the current destination using the current
    formatting properties.

If the RTF reader cannot find a particular control word or control symbol in
the look-up table described above, the control word or control symbol should be
ignored. If a control word or control symbol is preceded by an opening brace
({), it is part of a group. The current state should be saved on the stack, but
no state change should occur. When a closing brace (}) is encountered, the
current state should be retrieved from the stack, thereby resetting the current
state. If the \* control symbol precedes a control word, then it defines a
destination group and was itself preceded by an opening brace ({). The RTF
reader should discard all text up to and including the closing brace (}) that
closes this group. All RTF readers must recognize all destinations defined in
the March 1987 RTF Specification. The reader may skip past the group, but it is
not allowed to simply discard the control word. Destinations defined since
March 1987 are marked with the \* control symbol.

Note All RTF readers must implement the \* control symbol so that they can read
     RTF files written by newer RTF writers.

For control words or control symbols that the RTF reader can find in the
look-up table, the possible actions are as follows.

Change Destination
	    The RTF reader changes the destination to the destination described
	    in the table entry. Destination changes are legal only immediately
	    after an opening brace ({ ). (Other restrictions may also apply;
	    for example, footnotes cannot be nested.) Many destination changes
	    imply that the current property settings will be reset to their
	    default settings. Examples of control words that change destination
	    are \footnote, \header, \footer, \pict, \info, \fonttbl,
	    \stylesheet, and \colortbl. This RTF Specification identifies all
	    destination control words where they appear in control-word tables.

Change Formatting Property
	    The RTF reader changes the property as described in the table
	    entry. The entry will specify whether a parameter is required. The
	    "Appendix C: Index of RTF Control Words" section at the end of this
	    RTF Specification also specifies which control words require
	    parameters. If a parameter is needed and not specified, then a
	    default value will be used. The default value used depends on the
	    control word. If the control word does not specify a default, then
	    all RTF readers should assume a default of 0.

Insert Special Character
	    The reader inserts into the document the character code or codes
	    described in the table entry.

Insert Special Character and Perform Action
	    The reader inserts into the document the character code or codes
	    described in the table entry and performs whatever other action the
	    entry specifies. For example, when Microsoft Word interprets \par
	    (|\par-rtf|), a paragraph mark is inserted in the document and
	    special code is run to record the paragraph properties belonging
	    to that paragraph mark.

==============================================================================
Formal Syntax				*rtf-formal-syntax*

This RTF Specification describes RTF using the following syntax, based on
Backus-Naur Form.

Syntax       Meaning

#PCDATA      Text (without control words).
#SDATA       Hexadecimal data.
#BDATA       Binary data.
'c'          A literal.
<text>       A nonterminal.
A            The (terminal) control word a, without a parameter.
a or aN      The (terminal) control word a, with a parameter.
a?           Item a is optional.
a+           One or more repetitions of item a.
a*           Zero or more repetitions of item a.
a b          Item a followed by item b.
a | b        Item a or item b.
a & b        Item a and/or item b, in any order.

==============================================================================
Contents of an RTF File			*rtf-contents*

 An RTF file has the following syntax:

<File> := '{' <header> <document> '}'

This syntax is the standard RTF syntax; any RTF reader must be able to
correctly interpret RTF written to this syntax. It is worth mentioning again
that RTF readers do not have to use all control words, but they must be able to
harmlessly ignore unknown (or unused) control words, and they must correctly
skip over destinations marked with the \control* symbol. There may, however, be
RTF writers that generate RTF that does not conform to this syntax, and as
such, RTF readers should be robust enough to handle some minor variations.
Nonetheless, if an RTF writer generates RTF conforming to this specification,
then any correct RTF reader should be able to interpret it.

==============================================================================
RTF Header				*rtf-header*

The header has the following syntax:

<header> := |\rtf| <charset> |\deff|? <fonttbl> <filetbl>? <colortbl>?
            <stylesheet>? <listtables>? <revtbl>?

Each of the various header tables should appear, if they exist, in the
above order. Document properties can occur before and between the header
tables. A property must be defined before being referenced.
Specifically:

  - The style sheet must occur before any style usage.
  - The font table must precede any reference to a font.
  - The |\deff| keyword must precede any text without an explicit
    reference to a font, because it specifies the font to use in such cases.

==============================================================================
RTF Version				*rtf-version*

An entire RTF file is considered a group and must be enclosed in braces.
The |\rtf|N control word must follow the opening brace. The numeric
parameter N identifies the major version of the RTF Specification used.
The RTF standard described in this RTF Specification, although titled as
version 1.6, continues to correspond syntactically to RTF Specification
version 1. Therefore, the numeric parameter N for the |\rtf| control
word should still be emitted as 1.

==============================================================================
Character Set				*rtf-character-set*

After specifying the RTF version, you must declare the character set
used in this document. The control word for the character set must
precede any plain text or any table control words. The RTF Specification
currently supports the following character sets.

\ansi					*\ansi*
ANSI (the default)

\mac					*\mac*
Apple Macintosh

\pc					*\pc*
IBM PC code page 437

\pca					*\pca*
IBM PC code page 850, used by IBM Personal System/2 (not implemented in
version 1 of Microsoft Word for OS/2)

==============================================================================
Unicode RTF				*rtf-unicode*

Word 2000 is a Unicode-enabled application. Text is handled using the
16-bit Unicode character encoding scheme. Expressing this text in RTF
requires a new mechanism, because until this release (version 1.6), RTF
has only handled 7-bit characters directly and 8-bit characters encoded
as hexadecimal. The Unicode mechanism described here can be applied to
any RTF destination or body text.

\ansicpgN				*\ansicpg*
This keyword represents the ANSI code page that is used to perform the
Unicode to ANSI conversion when writing RTF text. N represents the code
page in decimal. This is typically set to the default ANSI code page of
the run-time environment (for example \ansicpg1252 for U.S. Windows).
The reader can use the same ANSI code page to convert ANSI text back to
Unicode. Possible values include:

437 -- United States IBM
708 -- Arabic (ASMO 708)
709 -- Arabic (ASMO 449+, BCON V4)
710 -- Arabic (transparent Arabic)
711 -- Arabic (Nafitha Enhanced)
720 -- Arabic (transparent ASMO)
819 -- Windows 3.1 (United States and Western Europe)
850 -- IBM multilingual
852 -- Eastern European
860 -- Portuguese
862 -- Hebrew
863 -- French Canadian
864 -- Arabic
865 -- Norwegian
866 -- Soviet Union
874 -- Thai
932 -- Japanese
936 -- Simplified Chinese
949 -- Korean
950 -- Traditional Chinese
1250 -- Windows 3.1 (Eastern European)
1251 -- Windows 3.1 (Cyrillic)
1252 -- Western European
1253 -- Greek
1254 -- Turkish
1255 -- Hebrew
1256 -- Arabic
1257 -- Baltic
1258 -- Vietnamese
1361 -- Johab

This keyword should be emitted in the RTF header section right after the
|\ansi|, |\mac|, |\pc| or |\pca| keyword.


\upr					*\upr*
This keyword represents a destination with two embedded destinations,
one represented using Unicode and the other using ANSI. This keyword
operates in conjunction with the |\ud| keyword to provide backward
compatibility. The general syntax is as follows:
>
    {\upr{keyword ansi_text}{\*\ud{keyword Unicode_text}}}

Notice that this keyword-destination does not use the \* (|\-asterix|)
keyword; this forces the old RTF readers to pick up the ANSI
representation and discard the Unicode one.

\ud					*\ud*
This is a destination that is represented in Unicode. The text is
represented using a mixture of ANSI translation and use of |\u|N
keywords to represent characters that do not have the exact ANSI
equivalent.

\uN					*\u*
This keyword represents a single Unicode character that has no
equivalent ANSI representation based on the current ANSI code page.
N represents the Unicode character value expressed as a decimal number.

This keyword is followed immediately by equivalent character(s) in ANSI
representation. In this way, old readers will ignore the |\u|N keyword
and pick up the ANSI representation properly. When this keyword is
encountered, the reader should ignore the next N characters, where
N corresponds to the last |\uc|N value encountered.

As with all RTF keywords, a keyword-terminating space may be present
(before the ANSI characters) that is not counted in the characters to
skip. While this is not likely to occur (or recommended), a |\bin|
keyword, its argument, and the binary data that follows are considered
one character for skipping purposes. If an RTF scope delimiter character
(that is, an opening or closing brace) is encountered while scanning
skippable data, the skippable data is considered to be ended before the
delimiter. This makes it possible for a reader to perform some
rudimentary error recovery. To include an RTF delimiter in skippable
data, it must be represented using the appropriate control symbol (that
is, escaped with a backslash,) as in plain text. Any RTF control word or
symbol is considered a single character for the purposes of counting
skippable characters.

An RTF writer, when it encounters a Unicode character with no
corresponding ANSI character, should output |\u|N followed by the best
ANSI representation it can manage. Also, if the Unicode character
translates into an ANSI character stream with count of bytes differing
from the current Unicode Character Byte Count, it should emit the |\uc|N
keyword prior to the |\u|N keyword to notify the reader of the change.

RTF control words generally accept signed 16-bit numbers as arguments.
For this reason, Unicode values greater than 32767 must be expressed as
negative numbers.

\ucN					*\uc*
This keyword represents the number of bytes corresponding to a given
|\u|N Unicode character. This keyword may be used at any time, and
values are scoped like character properties. That is, a |\uc|N keyword
applies only to text following the keyword, and within the same (or
deeper) nested braces. On exiting the group, the previous |\uc| value is
restored. The reader must keep a stack of counts seen and use the most
recent one to skip the appropriate number of characters when it
encounters a |\u|N keyword. When leaving an RTF group that specified
a |\uc| value, the reader must revert to the previous value. A default
of 1 should be assumed, if no |\uc| keyword has been seen in the current
or outer scopes.

A common practice is to emit no ANSI representation for Unicode
characters within a Unicode destination context (that is, inside a |\ud|
destination.). Typically, the destination will contain a \uc0 control
sequence. There is no need to reset the count on leaving the |\ud|
destination as the scoping rules will ensure the previous value is
restored.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Document Text				*document-text*

Document text should be emitted as ANSI characters. If there are Unicode
characters that do not have corresponding ANSI characters, they should
be output using the |\uc|N and |\u|N keywords.

For example, the text Lab&Gamma;Value (Unicode characters 0x004c,
0x0061, 0x0062, 0x0393, 0x0056, 0x0061, 0x006c, 0x0075, 0x0065) should
be represented as follows (assuming a previous |\ucl|):
>
    Lab\u915Gvalue

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Destination Text			*destination-text*

Destination text is defined as any text represented in an RTF
destination. A good example is the bookmark name in the |\bkmkstart|
destination.

Any destination containing Unicode characters should be emitted as two
destinations within a |\upr| destination to ensure that old readers can
read it properly and that no Unicode character encoding is lost when
read with a new reader.

For example, a bookmark name Lab&Gamma;Value (Unicode characters 0x004c,
0x0061, 0x0062, 0x0393, 0x0056, 0x0061, 0x006c, 0x0075, 0x0065) should
be represented as follows:
>
    {\upr{\*\bkmkstart LabGValue}{\*\ud{\*\bkmkstart Lab\u915 Value}}}

The first sub-destination contains only ANSI characters and is the
representation that old readers will see. The second sub-destination is
a \*|\ud| destination that contains a second copy of the |\bkmkstart|
destination. This copy can contain Unicode characters and is the
representation that Unicode-aware readers must pay attention to,
ignoring the ANSI-only version.

==============================================================================
Font Table				*rtf-font-table*

The |\fonttbl| control word introduces the font table group. Unique
|\f|N control words define each font available in the document, and are
used to reference that font throughout the document. This group has the
syntax listed in the following table.

<fonttbl> := '{' \fonttbl (<fontinfo> | ('{' <fontinfo> '}'))+ '}'

<fontinfo> := <fontnum> <fontfamily> <fcharset>? <fprq>? <panose>?
	      <nontaggedname>? <fontemb>? <codepage>? <fontname>
	      <fontaltname>? ';'

<fontnum> := |\f|

<fontfamily> := |\fnil| | |\froman| | |\fswiss| | |\fmodern|
                | |\fscript| | |\fdecor| | |\ftech| | |\fbidi|

<fcharset> := |\fcharset|

<fprq> := |\fprq|

<panose> := <data>

<nontaggedname> := \*\fname

<fontname> := #PCDATA

<fontaltname> := '{\*' |\falt| #PCDATA '}'

<fontemb> := '{\*' |\fontemb| <fonttype> <fontfname>? <data>? '}'

<fonttype> := |\ftnil| | |\fttruetype|

<fontfname> := '{\*' |\fontfile| <codepage>? #PCDATA '}'

<codepage> := |\cpg|

Note: For <fontemb>, either <fontfname> or <data> must be present,
although both may be present.

All fonts available to the RTF writer can be included in the font table,
even if the document doesn't use all the fonts.

RTF also supports font families, so that applications can attempt to
intelligently choose fonts if the exact font is not present on the
reading system. RTF uses the following control words to describe the
various font families.

\fnil					*\fnil*
Unknown or default fonts (the default)

\froman					*\froman*
Roman, proportionally spaced serif fonts
Times New Roman, Palatino

\fswiss					*\fswiss*
Swiss, proportionally spaced sans serif fonts
Arial

\fmodern				*\fmodern*
Fixed-pitch serif and sans serif fonts
Courier New, Pica

\fscript				*\fscript*
Script fonts
Cursive

\fdecor					*\fdecor*
Decorative fonts
Old English, ITC Zapf Chancery

\ftech					*\ftech*
Technical, symbol, and mathematical fonts
Symbol

\fbidi					*\fbidi*
Arabic, Hebrew, or other bidirectional font
Miriam

If an RTF file uses a default font, the default font number is specified
with the |\deff|N control word, which must precede the font-table group.
The RTF writer supplies the default font number used in the creation of
the document as the numeric argument N. The RTF reader then translates
this number through the font table into the most similar font available
on the reader's system.

The following control words specify the character set, alternative font
name, pitch of a font in the font table, and non-tagged font name.

\fcharsetN				*\fcharset*
Specifies the character set of a font in the font table. Values for
<i>N</i> are defined by Windows header files:

0 -- ANSI
1 -- Default
2 -- Symbol
3 -- Invalid
77 -- Mac
128 -- Shift Jis
129 -- Hangul
130 -- Johab
134 -- GB2312
136 -- Big5
161 -- Greek
162 -- Turkish
163 -- Vietnamese
177 -- Hebrew
178 -- Arabic
179 -- Arabic Traditional
180 -- Arabic user
181 -- Hebrew user
186 -- Baltic
204 -- Russian
222 -- Thai
238 -- Eastern European
254 -- PC 437
255 -- OEM

\falt					*\falt*
Indicates alternate font name to use if the specified font in the font
table is not available. '{\*' \falt <Alternate Font Name>'}'

\fprqN					*\fprq*
Specifies the pitch of a font in the font table.

\*\panose				*\*\panose*
Destination keyword. This destination contains a 10-byte Panose
1 number. Each byte represents a single font property as described by
the Panose 1 standard specification.

\*\fname				*\*\fname*
This is an optional control word in the font table to define the
non-tagged font name. This is the actual name of the font without the
tag, used to show which character set is being used. For example, Arial
is a non-tagged font name, and Arial (Cyrillic) is a tagged font name.
This control word is used by WordPad. Word ignores this control word
(and never creates it).


\fbiasN					*\fbias*
Used to arbitrate between two fonts when a particular character can
exist in either non-Far East or Far East font. Word 97-2000 emits the
|\fbias|N keyword only in the context of bullets or list information (that
is, a \listlevel destination). The default value of 0 for N indicates
a non-Far East font. A value of 1 indicates a Far East font. Additional
values may be defined in future releases.

If |\fprq| is specified, the N argument can be one of the following values.

Pitch            Value
Default pitch    0
Fixed pitch      1
Variable pitch   2


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Font Embedding				*font-embedding*

RTF supports embedded fonts with the |\fontemb| group located inside
a font definition. An embedded font can be specified by a file name, or
the actual font data may be located inside the group. If a file name is
specified, it is contained in the |\fontfile| group. The |\cpg| control
word can be used to specify the character set for the file name.

RTF supports TrueType(tm) and other embedded fonts. The type of the
embedded font is described by the following control words.

\ftnil					*\ftnil*
Unknown or default font type (the default)

\fttruetype				*\fttruetype*
TrueType font

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Code Page Support			*code-page-support*

A font may have a different character set from the character set of the
document. For example, the Symbol font has the same characters in the
same positions both on the Macintosh and in Windows. RTF describes this
with the |\cpg| control word, which names the character set used by the
font. In addition, file names (used in field instructions and in
embedded fonts) may not necessarily be the same as the character set of
the document; the |\cpg| control word can change the character set for
these file names as well. However, all RTF documents must still declare
a character set (that is, |\ansi|, |\mac|, |\pc|, or |\pca|) to maintain
backward compatibility with earlier RTF readers.

The table below describes valid values for |\cpg|.

Value  Description
437    United States IBM

==============================================================================
File Table				*rtf-file-table*

The |\filetbl| control word introduces the file table destination. The
only time a file table is created in RTF is when the document contains
subdocuments. This group defines the files referenced in the document
and has the following syntax:

<filetbl> := '{\*' |\filetbl| ('{' <fileinfo> '}')+ '}'

<fileinfo> := |\file| <filenum><relpath>?<osnum>? <filesource>+ <filename>

<filenum> := |\fid|

<relpath> := |\frelative|

<osnum> := |\fosnum|

<filesource> := |\fvalidmac| | |\fvaliddos| | |\fvalidntfs|
                | |\fvalidhpfs| | |\fnetwork|

<filename> := #PCDATA

Note: The file name can be any valid alphanumeric string for the named
file system, indicating the complete path and file name.


\filetbl				*\filetbl*
A list of documents referenced by the current document. The file table
has a structure analogous to the style or font table. This is
a destination control word output as part of the document header.

\file					*\file*
Marks the beginning of a file group that lists relevant information
about the referenced file. This is a destination control word.

\fidN					*\fid*
File ID number. Files are referenced later in the document using this number.

\frelativeN				*\frelative*
The character position within the path (starting at 0) where the
referenced file's path starts to be relative to the path of the owning
document. For example, if a document is saved to the path
C:\Private\Resume\File1.doc and its file table contains the path
C:\Private\Resume\Edu\File2.doc, then that entry in the file table will
be \frelative18, to point at the character "e" in "edu". This allows
preservation of relative paths.

\fosnumN				*\fosnum*
Currently only filled in for paths from the Macintosh file system. It is
an operating-system-specific number for identifying the file, which may
be used to speed up access to the file, or find it if the file has been
moved to another folder or disk. The Macintosh operating system name for
this number is the "file id." Additional meanings of the \fosnumN
control word may be defined for other file systems in the future.

\fvalidmac				*\fvalidmac*
Macintosh file system.

\fvaliddos				*\fvaliddos*
MS-DOS file system.

\fvalidntfs				*\fvalidntfs*
NTFS file system.

\fvalidhpfs				*\fvalidhpfs*
HPFS file system.

\fnetwork				*\fnetwork*
Network file system. This control word may be used in conjunction with
any of the previous file source control words.

==============================================================================
Color Table				*rtf-color-table*

The |\colortbl| control word introduces the color table group, which
defines screen colors, character colors, and other color information.
This group has the following syntax:

<colortbl> := '{' |\colortbl| <colordef>+ '}'

<colordef> := |\red|? & |\green|? & |\blue|? ';'

The following are valid control words for this group:

\redN					*\red*
Red index

\greenN					*\green*
Green index

\blueN					*\blue*
Blue index

Each definition must be delimited by a semicolon, even if the definition
is omitted. If a color definition is omitted, the RTF reader uses its
default color. The example below defines the default color table used by
Word. The first color is omitted, as shown by the semicolon following
the |\colortbl| control word. The missing definition indicates that
color 0 is the ''auto'' color.
>
    {\colortbl;\red0\green0\blue0;\red0\green0\blue255;\red0\green255\blue255;
    \red0\green255\blue0;
    \red255\green0\blue255;\red255\green0\blue0;\red255\green255\blue0;
    \red255\green255\blue255;\red0\green0\blue128;\red0\green128\blue128;
    \red0\green128\blue0;\red128\green0\blue128;\red128\green0\blue0;
    \red128\green128\blue0;\red128\green128\blue128;\red192\green192\blue192;}

The foreground and background colors use indexes into the color table to
define a color. For more information on color setup, see your Windows
documentation.


The following example defines a block of text in color (where
supported). Note that the cf/cb index is the index of an entry in the
color table, which represents a red/green/blue color combination.
>
    {\f1\cb1\cf2 This is colored text. The background is color
    1 and the foreground is color 2.}

If the file is translated for software that does not display color, the
reader ignores the color table group.

==============================================================================
Style Sheet				*rtf-style-sheet*

The |\stylesheet| control word introduces the style sheet group, which
contains definitions and descriptions of the various styles used in the
document. All styles in the document's style sheet can be included, even
if not all the styles are used. In RTF, a style is a form of shorthand
used to specify a set of character, paragraph, or section formatting.

The style-sheet group has the following syntax:

<stylesheet> := '{' |\stylesheet| <style>+ '}'

<style> := '{' <styledef>?<keycode>? <formatting> <additive>? <based>?
	   <next>? <autoupd>? <hidden>? <personal>? <compose>? <reply>?
	   <stylename>? ';' '}'

<styledef> := |\s| | \*|\cs| | |\ds|

<keycode> := '{' |\keycode| <keys> '}'

<keys> := ( |\shift|? & |\ctrl|? & |\alt|?) <key>

<key> := |\fn| | #PCDATA

<additive> := |\additive|

<based> := |\sbasedon|

<next> := |\snext|

<autoupd> := |\sautoupd|

<hidden> := |\shidden|

<personal> := |\spersonal|

<compose> := |\scompose|

<reply> := |\sreply|

<formatting> := (<brdrdef> | <parfmt> | <apoctl> | <tabdef> | <shading>
                | <chrfmt>)+

<stylename> := #PCDATA

For <style>, both <styledef> and <stylename> are optional; the default
is paragraph style 0. Note for <stylename> that Microsoft Word for the
Macintosh interprets commas in #PCDATA as separating style synonyms.
Also, for <key>, the data must be exactly one character.


\*\csN					*\*\cs*
Designates character style. Like |\s|, |\cs| is not a destination
control word. However, it is important to treat it like one inside the
style sheet; that is, |\cs| must be prefixed with \* (|\-asterix|) and
must appear as the first item inside a group. Doing so ensures that
readers that do not understand character styles will skip the character
style information correctly. When used in body text to indicate that
a character style has been applied, do not include the \* prefix
(|\-asterix|).

\sN					*\s-stylesheet*
Designates paragraph style.

\dsN					*\ds-stylesheet*
Designates section style.

\additive				*\additive*
Used in a character style definition ('{\*'\cs...'}'). Indicates that
character style attributes are to be added to the current paragraph
style attributes, rather than setting the paragraph attributes to only
those defined in the character style definition.

\sbasedonN				*\sbasedon*
Defines the number of the style on which the current style is based (the
default is 222&#0151;no style).

\snextN					*\snext*
Defines the next style associated with the current style; if omitted,
the next style is the current style.

\sautoupd				*\sautoupd*
Automatically update styles.

\shidden				*\shidden*
Style does not appear in the Styles drop-down list in the Style dialog
box (on the Format menu, click Styles).

Note: The hidden style property can only be accessed using Microsoft
Visual Basic(tm) for Applications.


\spersonal				*\spersonal*
Style is a personal e-mail style

\scompose				*\scompose*
Style is the e-mail compose style

\sreply					*\sreply*
Style is the e-mail reply style

\keycode				*\keycode*
This group is specified within the description of a style in the style
sheet in the RTF header. The syntax for this group is '{\*'\keycode
<keys>'}' where <keys> are the characters used in the key code. For
example, a style, Normal, may be defined {\s0 {\*\keycode \shift\ctrl
n}Normal;} within the RTF style sheet. See the Special Character control
words for the characters outside the alphanumeric range that may be
used.

\alt					*\alt*
The ALT modifier key. Used to describe shortcut-key codes for styles.

\shift					*\shift*
The SHIFT modifier key. Used to describe shortcut-key codes for styles.

\ctrl					*\ctrl*
The CTRL modifier key. Used to describe shortcut-key codes for styles.

\fnN					*\fn*
Specifies a function key where N is the function key number. Used to
describe shortcut-key codes for styles.

The following is an example of an RTF style sheet:
>
    {\stylesheet{\ql
    \li0\ri0\widctlpar\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0\itap0
    \fs24\lang1033\langfe1033\cgrid\langnp1033\langfenp1033
    \snext0 Normal;}
    {\*\cs10 \additive Default Paragraph Font;}{\*\cs15 \additive \b\ul\cf6
    \sbasedon10 UNDERLINE;}{\s16\qc \li0\ri0\widctlpar\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto
    \adjustright\rin0\lin0\itap0 \b\fs24\cf2\lang1033\langfe1033\cgrid\
    langnp1033\langfenp1033 \sbasedon0 \snext16 \sautoupd CENTER;}}

and RTF paragraphs to which the styles are applied:
>
    \pard\plain \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\outlinelevel0\
    adjustright\rin0\lin0\itap0 \fs24
    \lang1033\langfe1033\cgrid\langnp1033\langfenp1033
    {This is the Normal Style
    \par }\pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto
    \adjustright\rin0\lin0\itap0 {\par }\pard\plain \s16\qc
    \li0\ri0\widctlpar\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\outlinelevel0
    \adjustright\rin0\lin0\itap0 \b\fs24\cf2\lang1033\langfe1033\cgrid
    \langnp1033\langfenp1033
    {This is a centered paragraph with blue, bold font.&nbsp;&nbsp;I
    call the style CENTER.\par } \pard\plain \ql
    	    \li0\ri0\widctlpar\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright
    \rin0\lin0\itap0 \fs24\lang1033\langfe1033\cgrid\langnp1033\langfenp1033
    {\par The word \'93}{\cs15\b\ul\cf6 style}
    {\'94 is red and underlined.&nbsp;&nbsp;I used a style I called
    UNDERLINE.\par }

Some of the control words in this example are discussed in later
sections. In the example, note that the properties of the style were
emitted following the application of the style. This was done for two
reasons: (1) to allow RTF readers that don't support styles to still
retain all formatting; and, (2) to allow the additive model for styles,
where additional property changes are "added" on top of the defined
style. Some RTF readers may not "apply" a style upon only encountering
the style number without the accompanying formatting information because
of this.

==============================================================================
List Table				*rtf-list-table*

Word 97 and 2000 store bullets and numbering information very
differently from earlier versions of Word. In Word 6.0, for example,
number formatting data is stored individually with each paragraph. From
Word 97 onwards, however, all the formatting information is stored in
a pair of document-wide list tables that act as a style sheet, and each
individual paragraph stores only an index to one of the tables, like
a style index.

There are two list tables in Word: the List table (destination
|\listtable|), and the List Override table (destination
|\listoverridetable|).

The first table Word stores is the List table. A List table is a list of
lists (destination |\list|). Each list contains a number of list
properties that pertain to the entire list, and a list of levels
(destination |\listlevel)|, each of which contains properties that
pertain only to that level.

The syntax for the list table is the following:

<listtable> := '{' \*|\listtable| <list>+ '}'

<list> := |\list| |\listemplateid| & (|\listsimple| | |\listhybrid|)?
	  & <listlevel>+ & |\listrestarthdn| & |\listid| & (|\listname|
	  #PCDATA ';')

<listlevel> := <number> <justification> & |\leveljcn|N?
	       & |\levelstartat|N & (|\levelold|N & |\levelprev|N?
	       & |\levelprevspace|N? & |\levelspace|N?
	       & |\levelindent|N?)?  & <leveltext> & <levelnumbers>
	       & |\levelfollow|N & |\levellegal|N?
	       & |\levelnorestart|N? & <chrfmt>? & |\li|? & |\fi|?
	       & (|\jclisttab| |\tx|)?

<number> := |\levelnfc|N | |\levelnfcn|N | (|\levelnfc|N & |\levelnfcn|N)

<justification> := |\leveljc|N | |\leveljcn|N | (|\leveljc|N & |\leveljcn|N)

<leveltext> := '{' |\leveltext| 	|\leveltemplateid|? #SDATA ';' '}'

<levelnumbers> := '{' |\levelnumbers| #SDATA ';' '}'

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Top-Level List Properties		*top-level-list-properties*

\listidN				*\listid*
Each list must have a unique list ID that should be randomly generated.
The value N is a long integer. The list ID cannot be between -1 and -5.

\listtemplateidN			*\listtemplateid*
Each list should have a unique template ID as well, which also should be
randomly generated. The template ID cannot be -1. The value N is a long
integer.

\listsimpleN				*\listsimple*
1 if the list has one level; 0 (default) if the list has nine levels.

\listhybrid				*\listhybrid*
Present if the list is has 9 levels, each of which is the equivalent of
a simple list. Only one of |\listsimple| and |\listhybrid| should be
present. Word 2000 will write lists with the |\listhybrid| property.

\listrestarthdnN			*\listrestarthdn*
1 if the list restarts at each section; 0 if not. Used for Word 7.0
compatibility only.

\listname				*\listname*
The argument for |\listname| is a string that is the name of this list.
Names allow ListNum fields to specify the list they belong to. This is
a destination control word.

While Word 97 emitted simple or multilevel lists (not simple), Word 2000
emits hybrid lists, which are essentially collections of simple lists.
The main difference between Word 2000 hybrid lists and Word 97
multilevel ones is that each level of a hybrid list has a unique
identifier.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
List Levels				*list-levels*
Each list consists of either one or nine list levels depending upon
whether the |\listsimple| flag is set. Each list level contains a number
of properties that specify the formatting for that level, such as the
start-at value, the text string surrounding the number, its
justification and indents, and so on.

\levelstartatN				*\levelstartat*
N specifies the start-at value for the level

\levelnfcN				*\levelnfc*
Specifies the number type for the level:

0 -- Arabic (1, 2, 3)
1 -- Uppercase Roman numeral (I, II, III)
2 -- Lowercase Roman numeral (i, ii, iii)
3 -- Uppercase letter (A, B, C)
4 -- Lowercase letter (a, b, c)
5 -- Ordinal number (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
6 -- Cardinal text number (One, Two Three)
7 -- Ordinal text number (First, Second, Third)
10 -- Kanji numbering without the digit character (*dbnum1).
11 -- Kanji numbering with the digit character (*dbnum2).
1246 phonetic Katakana characters in "aiueo" order (*aiueo).
1346 phonetic katakana characters in "iroha" order (*iroha).
14 -- Double Byte character
15 -- Single Byte character
16 -- Kanji numbering 3 (*dbnum3).
17 -- Kanji numbering 4 (*dbnum4).
18 -- Circle numbering (*circlenum).
19 -- Double-byte Arabic numbering
2046 -- phonetic double-byte Katakana characters (*aiueo*dbchar).
2146 -- phonetic double-byte katakana characters (*iroha*dbchar).
22 -- Arabic with leading zero (01, 02, 03, ..., 10, 11)
23 -- Bullet (no number at all)
24 -- Korean numbering 2 (*ganada).
25 -- Korean numbering 1 (*chosung).
26 -- Chinese numbering 1 (*gb1).
27 -- Chinese numbering 2 (*gb2).
28 -- Chinese numbering 3 (*gb3).
29 -- Chinese numbering 4 (*gb4).
30 -- Chinese Zodiac numbering 1 (* zodiac1)
31 -- Chinese Zodiac numbering 2 (* zodiac2)
32 -- Chinese Zodiac numbering 3 (* zodiac3)
33 -- Taiwanese double-byte numbering 1
34 -- Taiwanese double-byte numbering 2
35 -- Taiwanese double-byte numbering 3
36 -- Taiwanese double-byte numbering 4
37 -- Chinese double-byte numbering 1
38 -- Chinese double-byte numbering 2
39 -- Chinese double-byte numbering 3
40 -- Chinese double-byte numbering 4
41 -- Korean double-byte numbering 1
42 -- Korean double-byte numbering 2
43 -- Korean double-byte numbering 3
44 -- Korean double-byte numbering 4
45 -- Hebrew non-standard decimal
46 -- Arabic Alif Ba Tah
47 -- Hebrew Biblical standard
48 -- Arabic Abjad style
255 -- No number

\leveljcN				*\leveljc*
0 -- Left justified
1 -- Center justified
2 -- Right justified

\levelnfcnN				*\levelnfcn*
Same arguments as |\levelnfc|. Takes priority over it if both are
present. In Word 97 |\levelnfc| was interpreted differently by the
Hebrew/Arabic versions. |\levelnfcn| in Word 2000 eliminates dual
interpretation while |\levelnfc| is still needed for backwards
compatibility.

\leveljcnN				*\leveljcn*
0 -- Left justified if for left-to-right paragraphs and right justified
     for right-to-left paragraphs
1 -- Center justified
2 -- Right justified if for left-to-right paragraphs and left justified
     for right-to-left paragraphs

Word 2000 prefers it over |\leveljc| if both are present, but it will be
written for backwards compatibility with older readers.

\leveloldN				*\levelold*
1 if this level was converted from Word 6.0 or 7.0, 0 if it is a native
Word 97-2000 level.

\levelprevN				*\levelprev*
1 if this level includes the text from the previous level (used for Word
7.0 compatibility only); otherwise, the value is 0 . This keyword will
only be valid if the |\levelold|N keyword is emitted.

\levelprevspaceN			*\levelprevspace*
1 if this level includes the indentation from the previous level (used
for Word 7.0 compatibility only); otherwise, the value is 0. This
keyword will only be valid if the |\levelold|N keyword is emitted.

\levelindentN				*\levelindent*
Minimum distance from the left indent to the start of the paragraph text
(used for Word 7.0 compatibility only). This keyword will only be valid
if the |\levelold|N keyword is emitted.

\levelspaceN				*\levelspace*
Minimum distance from the right edge of the number to the start of the
paragraph text (used for Word 7.0 compatibility only). This keyword will
only be valid if the |\levelold|N keyword is emitted.

\leveltext				*\leveltext*
If the list is hybrid, as indicated by |\listhybrid| we will find the
|\leveltemplateid|N keyword, whose argument is a unique level ID that
should be randomly generated. The value N is a long integer. The level
ID cannot be between -1 and -5.

The second argument for this destination should be the number format
string for this level. The first character is the length of the string,
and any numbers within the level should be replaced by the index of the
level they represent. For example, a level three number such as "1.1.1."
would generate the following RTF: "{\leveltext \leveltemplateidN
\'06\'00.\'01.\'02.}" where the '06 is the string length, the \'00,
\'01, and \'02 are the level place holders, and the periods are the
surrounding text. This is a destination control word.

\levelnumbers				*\levelnumbers*
The argument for this destination should be a string that gives the
offsets into the |\leveltext| of the level place holders. In the above
example, "1.1.1.", the |\levelnumbers| RTF should be
>
    {\levelnumbers \'01\'03\'05}

because the level place holders have indices 1, 3, and 5. This is
a destination control word.

\levelfollowN				*\levelfollow*
Specifies which character follows the level text:
0 -- Tab
1 -- Space
2 -- Nothing

\levellegalN				*\levellegal*
1 if any list numbers from previous levels should be converted to Arabic
numbers; 0 if they should be left with the format specified by their own
level's definition.

\levelnorestartN			*\levelnorestart*
1 if this level does not restart its count each time a number of
a higher level is reached, 0 if this level does restart its count each
time a number of a higher level is reached.

In addition to all of these properties, each list level can contain any
character properties (all of which affect all text for that level) and
any combination of three paragraph properties: left indents, first line
left indents, and tabs -- each of which must be of a special type:
|\jclisttab|. These paragraph properties will be automatically applied
to any paragraph in the list.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
List Override table			*list-override-table*

The List Override table is a list of list overrides (destination
|\listoverride|). Each list override contains the |\listid| of one of
the lists in the List table, as well as a list of any properties it
chooses to override. Each paragraph will contain a list override index
(keyword |\ls|) which is a 1-based index into this table. Most list
overrides don't override any properties -- instead, they provide
a level of indirection to a list. The two types of list overrides are,
in general: (1) formatting overrides, which allow a paragraph to be part
of a list, are numbered together with the other members of the list, but
have different formatting properties; and (2) start-at overrides, which
allow a paragraph to share the formatting properties of a list, but have
a different start-at values. The first element in the document with each
list override index takes the start-at value that the list override
specifies as its value, while each subsequent element is assigned the
number succeeding the previous element of the list.


List overrides have a few top-level keywords, including
a |\listoverridecount|, which contains a count of the number of levels
whose format is overridden. This |\listoverridecount| should always be
either 1 or 9, depending upon whether the list to be overridden is
simple or hybrid/multilevel. All of the actual override information is
stored within a list of list override levels (destination |\lfolevel|).

\listidN				|\listid|
Should exactly match the |\listid| of one of the lists in the List
table. The value N is a long integer.

\listoverridecountN			*\listoverridecount*
Number of list override levels within this list override (1 or 9).

\ls					*\ls-listoverride*
The (1-based) index of this |\listoverride| in the |\listoverride|
table. This value should never be zero inside a |\listoverride|, and
must be unique for all |\listoverride| within a document. The valid
values are from 1 to 2000.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
List override level			*list-override-level*

Each list override level contains flags to specify whether the
formatting or start-at values are being overridden for each level. If
the format flag (|\listoverrideformat|) is given, the |\lfolevel| should
also contain a list level (|\listlevel|). If the start-at flag
(|\listoverridestartat|) is given, a start-at value must be provided. If
the start-at is overridden but the format is not, then a |\levelstartat|
should be provided in the |\lfolevel| itself. If both start-at and
format are overridden, put the |\levelstartat| inside the |\listlevel|
contained in the |\lfolevel|.

\listoverridestartat			*\listoverridestartat*
Indicates an override of the start-at value.

\listoverrideformatN			*\listoverrideformat*
Number of list override levels within this list override (should be
either 1 or 9).

==============================================================================
Track Changes (Revision Marks)		*rtf-track-changes*

This table allows tracking of multiple authors and reviewers of
a document, and is used in conjunction with the character properties for
tracking changes (using revision marks).

\*\revtbl				*\*\revtbl*
This group consists of subgroups that each identify the author of
a revision in the document, as in {Author1;}. This is a destination
control word.

Revision conflicts, such as one author deleting another's additions, are
stored as one group, in the following form:
>
    CurrentAuthor\'00\'<length of previous author's name>PreviousAuthor\'00
    PreviousRevisionTime
<
===============================================================================
Document Area				*rtf-document-area*

Once the RTF header is defined, the RTF reader has enough information to
correctly read the actual document text. The document area has the following
syntax.

<document> := <info>? <docfmt>* <section>+

===============================================================================
Information Group			*rtf-information-group*

The |\info| control word introduces the information group, which contains
information about the document. This can include the title, author, keywords,
comments, and other information specific to the file. This information is for
use by a document-management utility, if available.

This group has the following syntax:

<info> := '{' <title>? & <subject>? & <author>? & <manager>? & <company>?
           <operator>? & <category>? & <keywords>? & <comment>? & |\version|?
	   & <doccomm>? & |\vern|? & <creatim>? & <revtim>? & <printim>?
	   & <buptim>?  & |\edmins|? & |\nofpages|? & |\nofwords|?
	   |\nofchars|? & |\id|? '}'

<title> := '{' |\title| #PCDATA '}'

<subject> := '{' |\subject| #PCDATA '}'

<author> := '{' |\author| #PCDATA '}'

<manager> := {' |\manager| #PCDATA '}'

<company> := {' |\company| #PCDATA '}'

<operator> := '{' |\operator| #PCDATA '}'

<category> := {' |\category| #PCDATA '}'

<keywords> := '{' |\keywords| #PCDATA '}'

<comment> := '{' |\comment| #PCDATA '}'

<doccomm> := '{' |\doccomm| #PCDATA '}'

<hlinkbase> := '{' |\hlinkbase| #PCDATA '}'

<creatim> := '{' |\creatim| <time> '}'

<revtim> := '{' |\revtim| <time> '}'

<printim> := '{' |\printim| <time> '}'

<buptim> := '{' |\buptim| <time> '}'

<time> := |\yr|? |\mo|? |\dy|? |\hr|? |\min|? |\sec|?

Some applications, such as Word, ask the user to type this information when
saving the document in its native format. If the document is then saved as an
RTF file or translated into RTF, the RTF writer specifies this information
using the following control words. These control words are destinations and
both the control words and the text should be enclosed in braces ({}).

\title					*\title-rtf*
Title of the document. This is a destination control word.

\subject				*\subject*
Subject of the document. This is a destination control word.

The |\userprops| control word introduces the user-defined document properties.
Unique |\propname| control words define each user-defined property in the
document. The group has the following syntax:

<userprops> := '{\*' |\userprops| ('{' <propinfo> '}'*) '}'

<propinfo> := <propname> <proptype> <staticval> <linkval>?

<propname> := '{' |\propname| #PCDATA '}'

<staticval> := |\staticval|

<linkval> := |\linkval|

\propname				*\propname*
The name of the user-defined property.

\staticval				*\staticval*
The value of the property.

\linkval				*\linkval*
The name of a bookmark that contains the text to display as the value of the
property.

Any control word described in the previous table that does not have a numeric
parameter specifies a date; all dates are specified with the |\yr| |\mo| |\dy|
|\hr| |\min| |\sec| controls. An example of an information group follows:
>
    {\info{\title Template}{\author John Doe}{\operator JOHN DOE}
    {\creatim\yr1999\mo4\dy27\min1}{\revtim\yr1999\mo4\dy27\min1}
    {\printim\yr1999\mo3\dy17\hr23\min5}{\version2}{\edmins2}{\nofpages183}
    {\nofwords53170}{\nofchars303071}{\*\company Microsoft}
    {\nofcharsws372192}{\vern8247}}

==============================================================================
Document Formatting Properties		*rtf-document-formatting-properties*

After the information group (if there are any), there may be some document
formatting control words (described as <docfmt> in the document area syntax
description). These control words specify the attributes of the document, such
as margins and footnote placement. These attributes must precede the first
plain-text character in the document.

The control words that specify document formatting are listed in the following
table (measurements are in twips; a twip is one-twentieth of a point). For
omitted control words, RTF uses the default values.


\deftabN				*\deftab*

N is the maximum number of consecutive lines that will be allowed to end in
a hyphen. 0 means no limit.

\hyphcaps				*\hyphcaps*
Toggles hyphenation of capitalized words (the default is on). Append 1 or
leave control word by itself to toggle property on; append 0 to turn it off.

Section Text				 *rtf-section-text*

Each section in the RTF file has the following syntax:

<section> := <secfmt>* <hdrftr>? <para>+ (|\sect| <section>)?


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Section Formatting Properties		*section-formatting-properties*

At the beginning of each section, there may be some section-formatting control
words (described as <secfmt> in the section text syntax description). These
control words specify section-formatting properties, which apply to the text
following the control word, with the exception of the section-break control
words (those beginning with |\sbk|). Section-break control words describe the
break preceding the text. These control words can appear anywhere in the
section, not just at the start.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Headers and Footers			*headers-and-footers*

Headers and footers are RTF destinations. Each section in the document can
have its own set of headers and footers. If no headers or footers are defined
for a given section, the headers and footers from the previous section (if
any) are used. Headers and footers have the following syntax:

<hdrftr> := '{' <hdrctl> <para>+ '}' <hdrftr>?

<hdrctl> := |\header| | |\footer| | |\headerl| | |\headerr| | |\headerf|
            | |\footerl| | |\footerr| | |\footerf|

Note:Each separate <hdrftr> group must have a distinct <hdrctl> introducing
it.

\header					*\header*
Header on all pages. This is a destination control word.

\footer					*\footer*
Footer on all pages. This is a destination control word.

\headerl				*\headerl*
Header on left pages only. This is a destination control word.

\headerr				*\headerr*
Header on right pages only. This is a destination control word.

\headerf				*\headerf*
Header on first page only. This is a destination control word.

\footerl				*\footerl*
Footer on left pages only. This is a destination control word.

\footerr				*\footerr*
Footer on right pages only. This is a destination control word.

\footerf				*\footerf*
Footer on first page only. This is a destination control word.


The |\headerl|, |\headerr|, |\footerl|, and |\footerr| control words are used
in conjunction with the |\facingp| control word, and the |\headerf| and
|\footerf| control words are used in conjunction with the |\titlepg| control
word. Many RTF readers will not function correctly if the appropriate document
properties are not set. In particular, if |\facingp| is not set, then only
|\header|and |\footer|should be used; if |\facingp| is set, then only
|\headerl|, |\headerr|, |\footerl|, and |\footerr| should be used.
Combining both |\facingp|and |\titlepg| is allowed. You should not use
|\header| to set the headers for both pages when |\facingp| is set. You can
use |\headerf| if |\titlepg| is not set, but no header will appear. For more
information, see |Document Formatting Properties| and |Section Formatting
Properties| in this RTF Specification.

If the previous section had a first page header or footer and had |\titlepg|
set, and the current section does not, then the previous section's first page
header or footer is disabled. However, it is not destroyed; if subsequent
sections have |\titlepg| set, then the first page header or footer is
restored.

===============================================================================
Paragraph Text				*rtf-paragraph-text*

There are two kinds of paragraphs: plain and table. A table is a collection of
paragraphs, and a table row is a continuous sequence of paragraphs partitioned
into cells. The |\intbl| paragraph-formatting control word identifies the
paragraph as part of a table. For more information, see the |Table
Definitions| section of this RTF Specification. This control is inherited
between paragraphs that do not have paragraph properties reset with |\pard|.

<para> := <textpar> | <row>

<textpar> := <pn>? <brdrdef>? <parfmt>* <apoctl>* <tabdef>? <shading>?
             (|\subdocument| | <char>+) (\par <para>)?

<row> := (<tbldef> <cell>+ <tbldef> |\row|) | (<tbldef> <cell>+ |\row|)
         | (<cell>+ <tbldef> |\row|)

<cell> := (<nestrow>? <tbldef>?) & <textpar>+ |\cell|

<nestrow> := <nestcell>+ '{\*'|\nesttableprops| <tbldef> |\nestrow| '}'

<nestcell> := <textpar>+ |\nestcell|

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Paragraph Formatting Properties		*paragraph-formatting-properties*

These control words (described as <parfmt> in the paragraph-text syntax
description) specify generic paragraph formatting properties. These control
words can appear anywhere in the body of the paragraph, not just at the

Bullets and Numbering			*bullets-and-numbering*

WORD 6.0/95 RTF

To provide compatibility with existing RTF readers, all applications that can
automatically format paragraphs with bullets or numbers will also emit the
generated text as plain text in the |\pntext| group. This will allow existing
RTF readers to capture the plain text and safely ignore the autonumber
instructions. This group precedes all bulleted or numbered paragraphs, and
will contain all the text and formatting that would be auto-generated. It
should precede the '{'\*\pn ...'}'  destination, and it is the responsibility
of RTF readers that understand the '{'\*\pn ... '}' destination to ignore the
|\pntext| group.

<pn> := <pnseclvl> | <pnpara>

<pnseclvl> := '{\*' |\pnseclvl| <pndesc>'}'

WORD 97-2000 RTF

Each paragraph that is part of a list must contain some keyword to indicate
which list it is in, and which level of the list it belongs to. Word 97-2000
also provides the flat-text representation of each number (in the |\listtext|
destination); so, RTF readers that don't understand Word 97 numbering will get
the paragraph number, together with appropriate character properties, inserted
into their document at the beginning of the paragraph. Any RTF reader that
does understand Word 97-2000 numbering should ignore the entire |\listtext|
destination.


\ls					*\ls*
Should exactly match the ls for one of the list overrides in the List Override
table.

\ilvl					*\ilvl*
The 0-based level of the list to which the paragraph belongs. For all simple
lists, this should always be 0 . For multilevel lists, it can be 0-8.

\listtext				*\listtext*
Contains the flat-text representation of the number, including character
properties. Should be ignored by any reader that understands Word 97-2000
numbering. This is a destination control word.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Revision Marks for Paragraph Numbers	*revision-marks-for-paragraph-numbers*

Paragraph numbers and ListNum fields track revision information with special
properties applied to the paragraph mark and ListNum field, respectively. The
special properties hold the "old" value of the number -- the value it held
when revision-mark tracking began. At display time, Word checks the number's
current value and compares it with this "old" value to tell if it has changed.
If the numbers are different, the old value shows up as deleted and the new
value as inserted; if the numbers are the same, Word displays the new value
normally, with no revision information. If there was no old value, the new
value shows up as inserted. The following table lists the RTF specifications
for these special properties.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Track Changes (Revision Mark) Properties for Paragraph Numbers
				*track-changes-for-paragraph-numbers*

\pnrauthN				*\pnrauth*
Index into the revision table. The content of the Nth group in the revision
table is considered to be the author of that revision.
Note:This keyword is used to indicate paragraph number revisions.

\pnrdateN				*\pnrdate*
Time of the revision. The 32-bit DTTM structure is emitted as a long integer.

\pnrnot					*\pnrnot*
Indicates if the paragraph number for the current paragraph is marked as
"inserted."

\pnrxstN				*\pnrxstN*
The keywords |\pnrxst|, |\pnrrgb|, |\pnrpnbr|, and |\pnrnfc| describe the
"deleted number" text for the paragraph number. Their values are binary. Each
of these keywords is represented as an array. The deleted number is written
out with a |\pnrstart| keyword, followed by the array's keyword, followed by
the first byte of the array, followed by the array's keyword, followed by the
second byte of the array's keyword, followed by the array's keyword, followed
by the third byte of the array's keyword, and so on. This sequence is followed
by the |\pnrstop| keyword.
|\pnrxst| is a 32-item Unicode character array (double bytes for each
character) with a length byte as the first number -- it has the actual text
of the number, with "level" place holders written out as digits from 0-8.

\pnrrgbN				*\pnrrgbN*
Nine-item array of indices of the level place holders in the |\pnrxst|  array.

\pnrnfcN				*\pnrnfcN*
Nine-item array containing the number format codes of each level (using the
same values as the |\levelnfc|keyword). The number format code is represented
as a short integer.

\pnrpnbrN				*\pnrpnbrN*
Nine-item array of the actual values of the number in each level. The number
is represented as a long integer

\pnrstartN				*\pnrstartN*
The |\pnrxst|, |\pnrrgb|, |\pnrpnbr|, and |\pnrnfc| arrays are each preceded
by the |\pnrstart| keyword, whose argument is 0-3 depending on the array.

\pnrstopN				*\pnrstopN*
The |\pnrxst|, |\pnrrgb|, |\pnrpnbr|, and |\pnrnfc|  arrays are each
terminated by the |\pnrstop| keyword, whose argument is the number of bytes
written out in the array.

Example:

Take an example of the number "3-4b," which represents the third level of the
list. The following table lists the values of each array.

Array   Binary             Comment
pnrxst  \'05\'00-\'01\'02  The length of the string is 5. Then, first level
			   (level 0), followed by a dash, followed by the
			   second and third levels (levels 1 and 2), followed
			   by a period.

pnrrgb  \'01\'03\'04       The level placeholders are at indices 1, 3, and
                           4 in the string.

pnrnfc  \'00\'00\'04       The nfc values are Arabic (0), Arabic (0), and
                           lowercase letter (4).

pnrpnbr \'03\'04\'02       The numbers or 3, 4, and 2 (b)

then be
>
    \dfrstart0\dfrxst0\dfrxst5\dfrxst0\dfrxst51\dfrxst0\dfrxst45\dfrxst0\dfrxst52
    \dfrxst0\dfrxst66\dfrxst0\dfrxst46\dfrstop10

where 5 is the length byte, 51 is Unicode for "3", 45 is Unicode for "-", 52
is Unicode for "4", and so on.

Positioned Objects and Frames		*positioned-objects-and-frames*

The following paragraph-formatting control words specify the location of
a paragraph on the page. Consecutive paragraphs with the same frame formatting
are considered part of the same frame. For two framed paragraphs to appear at
the same position on a page, they must be separated by a paragraph with
different or no frame information.


Note that if any paragraph in a table row has any of these control words
specified, then all paragraphs in the table row must have the same control
words specified, either by inheriting the properties from the previous
paragraph or by re-specifying the controls.

Table Definitions			*rtf-table-definitions*

There is no RTF table group; instead, tables are specified as paragraph
properties. A table is represented as a sequence of table rows. A table row is
a continuous sequence of paragraphs partitioned into cells. The table row
begins with the |\trowd| control word and ends with the |\row| control word.
Every paragraph that is contained in a table row must have the |\intbl|
control word specified or inherited from the previous paragraph. A cell may
have more than one paragraph in it; the cell is terminated by a cell mark (the
|\cell| control word), and the row is terminated by a row mark (the |\row|
control word). Table rows can also be positioned. In this case, every
paragraph in a table row must have the same positioning controls (see the
<apoctl> controls in the |positioned-objects-and-frames| sub-section of this
RTF Specification). Table properties may be inherited from the previous row;
therefore, a series of table rows may be introduced by a single <tbldef>.


An RTF table row has the following syntax, as shown in the general
paragraph-text syntax shown in the |paragraph-text| section of this RTF
Specification.


<row> := (<tbldef> <cell>+ <tbldef> |\row|) | (<tbldef> <cell>+ |\row|)
         | (<cell>+ <tbldef> |\row|)

<cell> := (<nestrow>? <tbldef>?) & <textpar>+ |\cell|

<nestrow> := <nestcell>+ '{\*'|\nesttableprops| <tbldef> |\nestrow| '}'

<nestcell> := <textpar>+ |\nestcell|


Note that while Word 97 emitted the row properties (<tbldef>) at the beginning
of the row, a reader should not assume that this is the case. Properties can
be emitted at the end and in fact Word 2000 does this. To avoid breaking
readers that might make the aforementioned assumption Word 2000 will write
a copy at the beginning as well, so the properties of a typical row in a Word
2000 document are repeated at the beginning and at the end of the row. Note
that for nested cells Word 2000 only writes the properties at the end.


A table definition has the following syntax:


<tbldef> := |\trowd| |\trgaph| & <rowjust>? & <rowwrite>? & <rowtop>?
	    & <rowbot>? & <rowleft>? & <rowright>? & <rowhor>? & <rowvert>?

To read negative |\expnd| values from Word for the Macintosh, an RTF reader
should use only the low-order 6 bits of the value read. Word for the Macintosh
does not emit negative values for |\expnd|. Instead, it treats values from 57
through 63 as  - 7 through  - 1, respectively (the low-order 6 bits of 57
through 63 are the same as  - 7 through  - 1).

Character Borders and Shading		*character-borders-and-shading*

Character shading has the following syntax.

<shading> := (|\chshdng| | <pat>) |\chcfpat|? |\chcbpat|?

<pat> := |\chbghoriz| | |\chbgvert| | |\chbgfdiag| | |\chbgbdiag|
	 | |\chbgcross| | |\chbgdcross| | |\chbgdkhoriz| | |\chbgdkvert|

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Track Changes (Revision Mark) Properties	*track-changes-properties*

\revised				*\revised*
Text has been added since revision marking was turned on.

\revauthN				*\revauth*
Index into the revision table. The content of the Nth group in the revision

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Associated Character Properties		*associated-character-properties*

Bidirectional-aware text processors often need to associate a Latin (or other
left-to-right) font with an Arabic or Hebrew (or other right-to-left) font.
The association is needed to match commonly used pairs of fonts in name, size,
and other attributes. Although RTF defines a broad variety of associated
character properties, any implementation may choose not to implement
a particular associated character property and share the property between the
Latin and Arabic fonts.

Property association uses the following syntax:

<atext> := <ltrrun> | <rtlrun>

<ltrrun> := |\rtlch| |\af| & <aprops>* |\ltrch| <ptext>

<rtlrun> := |\ltrch| |\af| & <aprops>* |\rtlch| <ptext>

<atext> := <losbrun> | <hisbrun> | <dbrun>

<losbrun> := |\hich| |\af| & <aprops> |\dbch| |\af| & <aprops> |\loch| <ptext>

<hisbrun> := |\loch| |\af| & <aprops> |\dbch| |\af| & <aprops> |\hich| <ptext>

<dbrun> := |\loch| |\af| & <aprops> |\hich| |\af| & <aprops> |\dbch| <ptext>

Here are some examples of property association:
>
    \ltrch\af2\ab\au\rtlch\u Sample Text

This is a right-to-left run. Text will use the default bidirectional font, and
will be underlined. The left-to-right font associated with this run is font
2 (in the font table) with bolding and underlining.
>
    \plain\rtlch\ltrch Sample Text

This is a left-to-right run. The right-to-left font and the left-to-right font
use the default font (specified by |\deff|).
>
    \rtlch\af5\ab\ai\ltrch\u Sample Text

This is a left-to-right run. The right-to-left font is font 5, bold and
italicized. The left-to-right font is the default font, underlined. If the
reader does not support underlining in the associated font, both fonts will be
underlined.

The property association control words (described as <aprops> in the syntax
description) are listed in the following table. Some control words (indicated
in the following table by an asterisk following the description) can be turned
off by the control word followed by 0.

\dbch					*\dbch*
The text consists of double-byte characters.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Highlighting				*rtf-highlighting*

This property applies highlighting to text. The formatting is not a character
format, so it cannot be part of a style definition.

\highlightN				*\highlight*
Highlights the specified text. N specifies the color as an index of the color
table.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Special Characters			*rtf-special-characters*

The RTF Specification includes control words for special characters (described
as <spec> in the character-text syntax description). If a special-character
control word is not recognized by the RTF reader, it is ignored, and the text
following it is considered plain text. The RTF Specification is flexible
enough to allow new special characters to be added for interchange with other
software.

The special RTF characters are listed in the following table.

\chdate					*\chdate*
Current date (as in headers).

\chdpl					*\chdpl*
Current date in long format (for example, Thursday, October 28, 1997).

\chdpa					*\chdpa*
Current date in abbreviated format (for example, Thu, Oct 28, 1997).

\chtime					*\chtime*
Current time (as in headers).

\chpgn					*\chpgn*

\nestrow				|\nestrow|
End of nested table row

\par					|\par-rtf|
End of paragraph.

\sect					|\sect|
End of section and paragraph.

\page					*\page*
Required page break.

\column					*\column*
Required column break.

\line					*\line-rtf*
Required line break (no paragraph break).

\lbrN					*\lbr*
Text wrapping break of type:
0 -- Default line break (just like |\line|)
1 -- Clear left
2 -- Clear right
3 -- Clear all
Whenever an |\lbr| is emitted, a |\line| will be emitted for the benefit of
old readers.

\softpage				*\softpage*
Nonrequired page break. Emitted as it appears in Galley view.

\softcol				*\softcol*
Nonrequired column break. Emitted as it appears in Galley view.

\softline				*\softline*
Nonrequired line break. Emitted as it appears in Galley view.

\softlheightN				*\softlheight*

Em-dash (&#0151;).

\endash					*\endash*
En-dash (&#0150;).

\emspace				*\emspace*
Nonbreaking space equal to width of character "m" in current font. Some old
RTF writers use the construct '{	|\emspace|  }' (with two spaces before the
closing brace) to trick readers unaware of |\emspace| into parsing a regular
space. A reader should interpret this as an |\emspace| and a regular space.

\enspace				*\enspace*
Nonbreaking space equal to width of character "n" in current font. Some old
RTF writers use the construct '{	|\enspace|  }' (with two spaces before the
closing brace) to trick readers unaware of |\enspace| into parsing a regular
space. A correct reader should interpret this as an |\enspace| and a regular
space.

\qmspace				*\qmspace*
One-quarter em space.

\bullet					*\bullet*
Bullet character.

\lquote					*\lquote*
Left single quotation mark.

\rquote					*\rquote*
Right single quotation mark.

\ldblquote				*\ldblquote*
Left double quotation mark.

\rdblquote				*\rdblquote*

delimiter for a string of formula typesetting commands.)

\~					*\~*
Nonbreaking space.

\-					*\-*
Optional hyphen.

\_					*\_*
Nonbreaking hyphen.

\:					*\:*
Specifies a subentry in an index entry.

\*					*\-asterix*
Marks a destination whose text should be ignored if not understood by the RTF
reader.

\'hh					*\'hh*
A hexadecimal value, based on the specified character set (may be used to
identify 8-bit values).

\ltrmark				*\ltrmark*
The following characters should be displayed from left to right; usually found
at the start of |\ltrch| runs.

\rtlmark				*\rtlmark*
The following characters should be displayed from right to left; usually found
at the start of |\rtlch| runs.

\zwbo					*\zwbo*
Zero-width break opportunity. Used to insert break opportunity between two
characters.

\zwnbo					*\zwnbo*
Zero-width nonbreak opportunity. Used to remove break opportunity between two
characters.

\zwj					*\zwj*
Zero-width joiner. This is used for ligating (joining) characters.

\zwnj					*\zwnj*
Zero-width nonjoiner. This is used for unligating a character.

A carriage return (character value 13) or linefeed (character value 10) will
be treated as a |\par-rtf| control if the character is preceded by a backslash.
You must include the backslash; otherwise, RTF ignores the control word. (You
may also want to insert a carriage-return/linefeed pair without backslashes at
least every 255 characters for better text transmission over communication
lines.)

A tab (character value 9) should be treated as a |\tab| control word. Not all
RTF readers understand this; therefore, an RTF writer should always emit the
control word for tabs.

The following are the code values for the special characters listed.

\keyword
Word for Windows and OS/2  Apple Macintosh

\bullet					|\bullet|
149 0xA5

\endash					|\endash|
150 0xD1

\emdash					|\emdash|

\lquote					|\lquote|
145 0xD4

\rquote					|\rquote|
146 0xD5

\ldblquote				|\ldblquote|
147 0xD2

\rdblquote				|\rdblquote|
148 0xD3

===============================================================================
Document Variables			*rtf-document-variables*

Document variables are definable and accessed through macros. The group has
the following syntax:

<variables> := '{\*' <docvar>'{' <varname> '}' '{' <vartext> '}' '}'*

<docvar> := |\docvar|

<varname> := #PCDATA

<vartype> := #PCDATA

\docvar					*\docvar*
A group that defines a document variable name and its value.

===============================================================================
Bookmarks				*rtf-bookmarks*

This destination may specify one of two control words: \*\bkmkstart, which
indicates the start of the specified bookmark, and \*\bkmkend, which indicates
the end of the specified bookmark.

Bookmarks have the following syntax:

<book> := <bookstart> | <bookend>

<bookstart> := '{\*' |\bkmkstart| (|\bkmkcolf|? & |\bkmkcoll|?) #PCDATA '}'

<bookend> := '{\*' |\bkmkend| #PCDATA '}'


A bookmark is shown in the following example:
>
    \pard\plain \fs20 Kuhn believes that science, rather than
    discovering in experience certain structured
    relationships, actually creates (or already participates in)
    a presupposed structure to which it fits the data.
    {\bkmkstart paradigm} Kuhn calls such a presupposed
    structure a paradigm.{\bkmkend paradigm}

The bookmark start and the bookmark end are matched with the bookmark tag. In
the example, the bookmark tag is "paradigm." Each bookmark start should have
a matching bookmark end; however, the bookmark start and the bookmark end may
be in any order.

\bkmkcolfN				*\bkmkcolf*
Is used to denote the first column of a table covered by a bookmark. If it is
not included, the first column is assumed. |\bkmkcoll|N is used to denote the
last column. If it is not used, the last column is assumed. These controls are
used within the \*\bkmkstart destination following the |\bkmkstart| control.
For example, {\*\bkmkstart\bkmkcolf2\bkmkcoll5 Table1} places the bookmark
"Table1" on columns 2 through 5 of a table.

===============================================================================
Pictures				*rtf-pictures*

An RTF file can include pictures created with other applications. These
pictures can be in hexadecimal (the default) or binary format. Pictures are
destinations, and begin with the |\pict| control word. The |\pict| keyword is
preceded by |\*\shppict|  destination control keyword as described in the
following example. A picture destination has the following syntax:

<pict> := '{' |\pict| (<brdr>? & <shading>? & <picttype> & <pictsize>
          & <metafileinfo>?) <data> '}'

<picttype> := |\emfblip|  | |\pngblip| | |\jpegblip| | |\macpict|
	      | |\pmmetafile| | 	|\wmetafile| | |\dibitmap| <bitmapinfo>
	      | |\wbitmap| <bitmapinfo>

<bitmapinfo> := |\wbmbitspixel| & |\wbmplanes| & |\wbmwidthbytes|

<pictsize> := (|\picw| & |\pich|) |\picwgoal|? & |\pichgoal|? |\picscalex|?
	      & |\picscaley|? & 	|\picscaled|? & |\piccropt|? & |\piccropb|?
	      & |\piccropr|?  & 	|\piccropl|?

<metafileinfo> := |\picbmp| & |\picbpp|

<data> := (|\bin| #BDATA) | #SDATA


These control words are described in the following table. Some measurements in
this table are in twips; a twip is one-twentieth of a point.

\emfblip				*\emfblip*
Source of the picture is an EMF (enhanced metafile).

\pngblip				*\pngblip*
Source of the picture is a PNG.

\jpegblip				*\jpegblip*
Source of the picture is a JPEG.

\shppict				*\shppict*
Specifies a Word 97-2000 picture. This is a destination control word.

\nonshppict				*\nonshppict*
Specifies that Word 97-2000 has written a {\pict destination that it will not
read on input. This keyword is for compatibility with other readers.

\macpict				*\macpict*
Source of the picture is QuickDraw.

\pmmetafileN				*\pmmetafile*
Source of the picture is an OS/2 metafile. The N argument identifies the
metafile type. The N values are described in the |\pmmetafile| table below.

\wmetafileN				*\wmetafile*
Source of the picture is a Windows metafile. The N argument identifies the
metafile type (the default is 1).

\dibitmapN				*\dibitmap*
Source of the picture is a Windows device-independent bitmap. The N argument
identifies the bitmap type (must equal 0).

The information to be included in RTF from a Windows device-independent bitmap
is the concatenation of the BITMAPINFO structure followed by the actual pixel
data.


\wbitmapN				*\wbitmap*
Source of the picture is a Windows device-dependent bitmap. The N argument
identifies the bitmap type (must equal 0).

The information to be included in RTF from a Windows device-dependent bitmap
is the result of the GetBitmapBits function.


Example:
>
    {\*\shppict {\pict \emfblip ... .. }}{\nonshppict {\pict ... .}}

For more information on the GetDIBits and GetBitmapBits functions and the
structure of Windows device-independent and device-dependent bitmaps, see
Volume 1 and Volume 2 of the Programmer's Reference in the Microsoft Windows
3.1 Software Development Kit. For best device-independence and
interoperability with Microsoft products, however, use of the |\wbitmap| and
|\dibitmap| control words is discouraged. Rather, bitmaps should be embedded
within Windows metafiles and the |\wmetafile| control word used. For more
information on embedding bitmaps within metafiles, see Volume 1 and Volume
2 of the Programmer's Reference in the Microsoft Windows 3.1 Software
Development Kit.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bitmap Information			*bitmap-information*

\wbmbitspixelN				*\wbmbitspixel*
Number of adjacent color bits on each plane needed to define a pixel (the
default is 1). || Possible values are 1 (monochrome), 4 (16 colors), 8 (256
colors) and 24 (RGB).

\wbmplanesN				*\wbmplanes*
Number of bitmap color planes (must equal 1).

\wbmwidthbytesN				*\wbmwidthbytes*
Specifies the number of bytes in each raster line. This value must be an even
number because the Windows graphics device interface (GDI) assumes that the
bit values of a bitmap form an array of integer (two-byte) values. In other
words, |\wbmwidthbytes| times 8 must be the next multiple of 16 greater than
or equal to the |\picw| (bitmap width in pixels) value.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Picture Size, Scaling, and Cropping	*picture-size-scaling-cropping*

\picwN					*\picw*
xExt field if the picture is a Windows metafile; picture width in pixels if
the picture is a bitmap or from QuickDraw. The N argument is a long integer.

\pichN					*\pich*
yExt field if the picture is a Windows metafile; picture height in pixels if
the picture is a bitmap or from QuickDraw. The N argument is a long integer.

\picwgoalN				*\picwgoal*
Desired width of the picture in twips. The N argument is a long integer.

\pichgoalN				*\pichgoal*
Desired height of the picture in twips. The N argument is a long integer.

Horizontal scaling value. The N argument is a value representing a percentage
(the default is 100).

\picscaleyN				*\picscaley*
Vertical scaling value. The N argument is a value representing a percentage
(the default is 100).

\picscaled				*\picscaled*
Scales the picture to fit within the specified frame. Used only with
|\macpict| pictures.

\picprop				*\picprop*
Indicates that shape properties are applied to an inline picture. This is
a destination control word.

\defshp					*\defshp*
Indicates that the inline picture is a WordArt shape.

\piccroptN				*\piccropt*
Top cropping value in twips. A positive value crops toward the center of the
picture; a negative value crops away from the center, adding a space border
around picture (the default is 0).

\piccropbN				*\piccropb*
Bottom cropping value in twips. A positive value crops toward the center of
the picture; a negative value crops away from the center, adding a space
border around picture (the default is 0).

\piccroplN				*\piccropl*
Left cropping value in twips. A positive value crops toward the center of the
picture; a negative value crops away from the center, adding a space border
around picture (the default is 0).

\piccroprN				*\piccropr*
Right cropping value in twips. A positive value crops toward the center of the
picture; a negative value crops away from the center, adding a space border
around picture (the default is 0).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Metafile Information			*metafile-information*

\picbmp					*\picbmp*
Specifies whether a metafile contains a bitmap.

\picbppN				*\picbpp*
Specifies the bits per pixel in a metafile bitmap. The valid range is 1 - 32,
with 1, 4, 8, and 24 being recognized.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Picture Data				*picture-data*

\binN					*\bin*
The picture is in binary format. The numeric parameter N is the number of
bytes that follow. Unlike all other controls, this control word takes a 32-bit
parameter.

\blipupiN				*\blipupi*
N represents units per inch on a picture (only certain image types need or
output this)

\blipuid				*\blipuid*
Used as: {\*\blipuid XXXXX} where XXXX is a 16-byte identification number for
the image.

\bliptagN				*\bliptag*
A mostly unique identifier for a picture, where  N is a long integer value.

The |\wbitmap| control word is optional. If no other picture type is
specified, the picture is assumed to be a Windows bitmap. If |\wmetafile| is
specified, the N argument can be one of the following types.

Type            N argument

MM_TEXT         1
MM_LOMETRIC     2
MM_HIMETRIC     3
MM_LOENGLISH    4
MM_HIENGLISH    5
MM_TWIPS        6
MM_ISOTROPIC    7
MM_ANISOTROPIC  8

For more information about these types, see volume 1 of the Programmer's
Reference in the Microsoft Windows 3.1 Software Development Kit.

If |\pmmetafile| is specified, the N argument can be one of the following types.

Type		N argument

PU_ARBITRARY    0x0004
PU_PELS         0x0008
PU_LOMETRIC     0x000C
PU_HIMETRIC     0x0010
PU_LOENGLISH    0x0014
PU_HIENGLISH    0x0018
PU_TWIPS        0x001C


For more information about these types, see volume 2 of the OS/2 Programmer's
Reference.

Be careful with spaces following control words when dealing with pictures in
binary format. When reading files, RTF considers the first space after
a control word the delimiter and subsequent spaces part of the document text.
Therefore, any extra spaces are attached to the picture, with unpredictable
results.

RTF writers should not use the carriage-return/linefeed (CR/LF) combination to
break up pictures in binary format. If they do, the CR/LF combination is
treated as literal text and considered part of the picture data.

The picture in hexadecimal or binary format follows the picture-destination
control words. The following example illustrates the destination format:
>

==============================================================================
Objects					*rtf-objects*

Microsoft OLE links, Microsoft OLE embedded objects, and Macintosh Edition
Manager subscriber objects are represented in RTF as objects. Objects are
destinations that contain a data part and a result part. The data part is
generally hidden to the application that produced the document. A separate
application uses the data and supplies the appearance of the data. This
appearance is the result part of the object.

The representation of objects in RTF is designed to allow RTF readers that
don't understand objects or don't use a particular type of object to use the
current result in place of the object. This allows the appearance of the
object to be maintained through the conversion even though the object
functionality is lost. Each object comes with optional information about the
object, a required destination that contains the object data, and an optional
result that contains the current appearance of the object. This result
contains standard RTF. It is an important responsibility of the RTF writer to
provide the result, so that existing RTF readers that either do not support
objects or do not support the particular type of object will be able to
display the object.

When the object is an OLE embedded or linked object, the data part of the
object is the structure produced by the OLESaveToStream function. Some OLE
clients rely on the OLE system to render the object and a copy of the result
is not available to the RTF writer for that application. For these cases, the
object result can be extracted from the structure produced by the
OLESaveToStream function. || For information about the OLESaveToStream
function, see the Microsoft Object Linking and Embedding Software Development
Kit.

The syntax for this destination is:

<obj> := ('{' |\object| (<objtype> & <objmod>? & <objclass>? & <objname>?
	 & <objtime>? & <objsize>? & <rsltmod>?) <objdata> <result> '}')
	 | <pubobject>

<objtype> := |\objemb| | |\objlink| | |\objautlink| | |\objsub| | |\objpub|
             | |\objicemb| | |objhtml| | |objocx|

<objmod> := |\linkself|? & |\objlock|? | |\objupdate|?

<objclass> := '{\*' |\objclass| #PCDATA '}'

<objname> := '{\*' |\objname| #PCDATA '}'

<objtime> := '{\*' |\objtime| <time> '}'

<rsltmod> := |\rsltmerge|? & <rslttype>?

<rslttype> := |\rsltrtf| | |\rslttxt| | |\rsltpict| | |\rsltbmp| | |\rslthtml|

<objsize> := |\objsetsize|? & |\objalign|? & |\objtransy|? & |<objhw>|?
	     & |\objcropt|? & |\objcropb|? & |\objcropl|? & |\objcropr|?
	     & |\objscalex|?  & 	|\objscaley|?

<objhw> := |\objh| & |\objw|

<objdata> := '{\*' |\objdata| (<objalias>? & <objsect>?) <data> '}'

<objalias> := '{\*' |\objalias| <data> '}'

<objsect> := '{\*' |\objsect| <data> '}'

<result> := '{' |\result| <para>+ '}'

\objlock				*\objlock*
Locks the object from any updates.

\objupdate				*\objupdate*
Forces an update to the object before displaying it. Note that this will
override any values in the <objsize> control words, but reasonable values
should always be provided for these to maintain backwards compatibility.

\objclass				*\objclass*
The text argument is the object class to use for this object; ignore the class
specified in the object data. This is a destination control word.

\objname				*\objname*
The text argument is the name of this object. This is a destination control
word.

\objtime				*\objtime*
Describes the time that the object was last updated.


Object Size, Position, Cropping, and Scaling
*Object Size, Position, Cropping, and Scaling*

\objhN					*\objh*
N is the original object height in twips, assuming the object has a graphical
representation.

\objwN					*\objw*
N is the original object width in twips, assuming the object has a graphical
representation.

\objsetsize				*\objsetsize*
Forces the object server to set the object's dimensions to that specified by
the client.

\objalignN				*\objalign*
N is the distance in twips from the left edge of the objects that should be
aligned on a tab stop. This is needed to place Equation Editor equations
correctly in line.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Object Data				*object-data*

\objdata				*\objdata*
This subdestination contains the data for the object in the appropriate
format; OLE objects are in OLESaveToStream format. This is a destination
control word.

\objalias				*\objalias*
This subdestination contains the alias record for the publisher object for the
Macintosh Edition Manager. This is a destination control word.

\objsect				*\objsect*
This subdestination contains the section record for the publisher object for
the Macintosh Edition Manager. This is a destination control word.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Object Result				*object-result*

\rsltrtf				*\rsltrtf*

\rsltmerge				*\rsltmerge*
Uses the formatting of the current result whenever a new result is obtained.

\result					*\result*
The result destination is optional in the |\object| destination. It contains
the last update of the result of the object. The data of the result
destination should be standard RTF so that RTF readers that don't understand
objects or the type of object represented can use the current result in the
object's place to maintain appearance. This is a destination control word.


When Word is used as an editor for Mail, the following control word can be
emitted. It is not seen in other situations.

\objattph				*\objattph*
Object attachment placeholder. Used in the RTF stream when Word is started as
a mail editor and the message contains attachments. The control word tells
where in the text stream the attachment should be placed. It does not define
the actual attachment.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Macintosh Edition Manager Publisher Objects
			*macintosh-edition-manager-publisher-objects*

Word for the Macintosh writes publisher objects for the Macintosh Edition
Manager in terms of bookmarks (see the |rtf-bookmarks| section of this RTF
Specification). The range of publisher objects are marked as bookmarks, so
these controls are all used within the |\bkmkstart| destination. The RTF
syntax for a publisher object is:

<pubobject> := '{\*' |\bkmkstart| |\bkmkpub|  |\pubauto| ? (<objalias>?
               & <objsect>) #PCDATA '}'

\bkmkpub				*\bkmkpub*
The bookmark marks a Macintosh Edition Manager publisher object.

\pubauto				*\pubauto*
The publisher object updates all Macintosh Edition Manager subscribers of this
object automatically whenever it is edited.

===============================================================================
Footnotes				*rtf-footnotes*

The |\footnote| control word introduces a footnote. Footnotes are destinations
in RTF. A footnote is anchored to the character that immediately precedes the
footnote destination (that is, the footnote moves with the character to which
it is anchored). If automatic footnote numbering is defined, the destination
can be preceded by a footnote reference character, identified by the control
word |\chftn|. No Microsoft product supports footnotes within headers,
footers, or comments (annotations). Placing a footnote within headers,
footers, or comments (annotations) will often result in a corrupted document.

Footnotes have the following syntax.

<foot> := '{' |\footnote| <para>+ '}'


Here is an example of a destination containing footnotes:
>
    \ftnbj\ftnrestart \sectd \linemod0\linex0\endnhere \pard\plain
    \ri1170 \fs20 {\pu6 Mead's landmark study has been amply annotated.\chftn
    {\footnote \pard\plain \s246 \fs20 {\up6\chftn }See Sahlins, Bateson, and
    Geertz for a complete bibliography.}
    It was her work in America during the Second World War, however, that
    forms the basis for the paper. As others have noted, \chftn
    {\footnote \pard\plain \s246 \fs20 {\up6\chftn}
    A complete bibliography will be found at the end of this chapter.}
    this period was a turning point for Margaret Mead.}
    \par


To indicate endnotes, the following combination is emitted: \footnote\ftnalt.
Existing readers will ignore the |\ftnalt| control word and treat everything
as a footnote.

For other control words relating to footnotes, see the sections titled
|document-formatting-properties|, |section-formatting-properties|, and
|rtf-special-characters| in this RTF Specification.

===============================================================================
Comments (Annotations)			*rtf-comments*

RTF comments (annotations) have two parts; the author ID (introduced by the
control word |\atnid|) and the annotation text (introduced by the control word
|\annotation|); there is no group enclosing both parts. No Microsoft product
supports comments (annotations) within headers, footers, or footnotes. Placing
an annotation within headers, footers, or footnotes will often result in
a corrupted document. Each part of the annotation is an RTF destination.
Comments (annotations) are anchored to the character that immediately precedes
the annotation.

If an annotation is associated with an annotation bookmark, the following two
destination control words precede and follow the bookmark. The alphanumeric
string N, such as a long integer, represents the bookmark name.

<atrfstart> := '{\*' |\atrfstart| N '}'

<atrfend> := '{\*' |\atrfend| N '}'

Comments (annotations) have the following syntax:

<annot> := <annotid> <atnauthor> <atntime>? |\chatn| <atnicn>? <annotdef>

<annotid> := '{\*' |\atnid| #PCDATA '}'

<atnauthor> := '{\*' |\atnauthor| #PCDATA '}'

<annotdef> := '{\*' |\annotation| <atnref> <para>+ '}'

<atnref> := '{\*' |\atnref| N '}'

<atntime> := '{\*' |\atntime| <time> '}'

<atnicn> := '{\*' |\atnicn| <pict> '}'

An example of annotation text follows:
>
    An example of a paradigm might be Newtonian physics or
    Darwinian biology.{\v\fs16 {\atnid bz}\chatn{\*\annotation
    \pard\plain \s224 \fs20 {\field{\fldinst page \\#'"Page:
    '#'\line'"}{\fldrslt}}{\fs16 \chatn }
    How about some examples that deal with social science?
    That's what this paper is about.}}

Comments (annotations) may have optional time stamps (contained in the
|\atntime| destination) or icons (contained in the |\atnicn| destination).

===============================================================================
Fields					*rtf-fields*

The |\field| control word introduces a field destination that contains the
text of fields. Fields have the following syntax:

<field> := '{' |\field| <fieldmod>? <fieldinst> <fieldrslt> '}'

<fieldmod> := |\flddirty|? & |\fldedit|? & |\fldlock|? & |\fldpriv|?

<fieldinst> := '{\*' |\fldinst|<para>+ <fldalt>? '}'

<fldalt> := |\fldalt|

<fieldrslt> := '{' |\fldrslt|<para>+ '}'


Several control words alter the interpretation of the field. These control
words are listed in the following table.

\flddirty				*\flddirty*
A formatting change has been made to the field result since the field was last
updated.

\fldedit				*\fldedit*
Text has been added to, or removed from, the field result since the field was
last updated.

\fldlock				*\fldlock*
Field is locked and cannot be updated.

\fldpriv				*\fldpriv*
Result is not in a form suitable for display (for example, binary data used by
fields whose result is a picture).


Two subdestinations are required within the |\field| destination. They must be
enclosed in braces ({ }) and begin with the following control words.


\fldinst				*\fldinst*
Field instructions. This is a destination control word.

\fldrslt				*\fldrslt*
Most recent calculated result of the field. This is a destination control
word.


If the instruction for a field contains a file name, then the |\cpg| control
can be used to define the character set of the file name. See |Code Page
Support| in this RTF Specification for details.

The |\fldrslt| control word should be included even if no result has been
calculated because most readers (even those readers that do not recognize
fields) can generally include the value of the |\fldrslt| destination in the
document. A field result should not start with a table, because this will
break some RTF readers.


An example of some field text follows:
>
    {\field {\*\fldinst AUTHOR \\*MERGEFORMAT   }{\fldrslt Joe
    Smith}}\par\pard {\field{\*\fldinst time \\@ "h:mm AM/PM"}{\fldrslt 8:12
    AM}}

You can use the |\fldalt| control word to specify that the given field
reference is to an endnote. For example, the following field in RTF is
a reference to a footnote
>
    {\field{\*\fldinst NOTEREF _RefNumber } {\fldrslt 1}}

The following is an example of a reference to an endnote
>
    {\field{\*\fldinst NOTEREF _RefNumber \fldalt } {\fldrslt I}}

If the specified field is a form field, the \*|\datafield| destination appears
as a part of <char> and contains the binary data of a form field instruction.
For example:
>
    {\field{\*\fldinst {\*\bkmkstart Text1} FORMTEXT {{\*\datafield
    00000000000000000554657874310008476565207768697a0000000000000000000000}}}{\fldrslt
    Default Result}}{\*\bkmkend Text1}

Note:The |\datafield| destination requires the \* prefix. The |\fldtype|,
|\date| |\time| and |\wpeqn| field keywords should be ignored.

===============================================================================
Form Fields				*rtf-form-fields*

\formfield				*\formfield*
Group destination keyword indicating start of form field data.

\fftypeN				*\fftype*
Form field type:
0 -- Text

\ffresN					*\ffres*
Result field for a form field. Values from 0 to N-1, where  N is the number of
|\ffl|entries.

===============================================================================
Index Entries				*rtf-index-entries*

The |\xe| control word introduces an index entry. Index entries in RTF are
destinations. An index entry has the following syntax:

<idx> := '{' |\xe| (|\xef|? & |\bxe|? & |\ixe|?) <entry> (<txe> | <rxe>)? '}'

<entry> := (<char>+ <yxe>?) | ('{' <char>+ <yxe>? '}')

<yxe> := |\yxe| <char>+ #PCDATA

<txe> := '{' |\txe| <char>+ #PCDATA'}'

<rxe> := '{' |\rxe| #PCDATA '}'


If the text of the index entry is not formatted as hidden text with the |\v|
control word, the text is put into the document as well as into the index. For
more information on the |\v| control word, see |Font (Character) Formatting
Properties| in this RTF Specification. Similarly, the text of the |\txe|
subdestination, described later in this section, becomes part of the document
if it is not formatted as hidden text.

The following control words may also be used.

\xefN					*\xef*
Allows multiple indexes within the same document. N is an integer that
corresponds to the ASCII value of a letter between A and Z.

\bxe					*\bxe*
Formats the page number or cross-reference in bold.

\ixe					*\ixe*
Formats the page number or cross-reference in italic.

\txe					*\txe*
Text argument to be used instead of a page number. This is a destination
control word.

\rxe					*\rxe*
Text argument is a bookmark for the range of page numbers. This is
a destination control word.

\yxe					*\yxe*
Pronunciation (or heading) for index entry, used in phonetic sorting.

\*\pxe					*\*\pxe*
"Yomi" (pronunciation) for index entry.

===============================================================================
Table of Contents Entries		*rtf-toc-entries*

The |\tc| control word introduces a table of contents entry that can be used
to build the actual table of contents. The |\tcn| control word marks a table
of contents entry that will not have a page number associated with it; this is
used in place of |\tc| for such entries. Table of contents entries are
destinations, and they have the following syntax:

<toc> := '{' |\tc| | |\tcn| (|\tcf|? & |\tcl|?) <char>+ '}'

As with index entries, text that is not formatted as hidden with the |\v|
character-formatting control word is put into the document. The following
control words can also be used in this destination.

\tcfN					*\tcf*
Type of table being compiled. N is mapped by existing Microsoft software to
a letter between A and Z (the default is 67, which maps to C, used for tables
of contents).

\tclN					*\tcl*
Level number (the default is 1).

===============================================================================
Bidirectional Language Support		*rtf-bidirectional-language-support*

RTF supports bidirectional writing orders for languages such as Arabic. The
controls are described below (as well as in the appropriate sections
throughout this RTF Specification). Also refer to the associated character
properties defined in |associated-character-properties| in this RTF
Specification.
